## What You'll Learn

- **Identifiers**: How to name variables and functions in Python (rules and best practices).
- **Reserved Words**: List of keywords you cannot use as names (e.g., `if`, `for`, `class`).
- **Data Types**:
	- `int`, `float`, `complex`: Numbers (integers, decimals, complex numbers)
	- `bool`: Boolean values (`True` or `False`)
	- `str`: Text (strings)
- **Type Casting**: Changing a value from one type to another (e.g., string to integer).
- **Immutability vs Mutability**:
	- Immutable types: Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., `str`, `tuple`)
	- Mutable types: Can be changed (e.g., `list`, `dict`)
- **Collection Data Types**:
	- `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `frozenset`, `dict`, `range`, `bytes`, `bytearray`: Ways to store and organize multiple values.
- **None Type**: Represents "no value" or "nothing here" in Python.
- **Escape Characters**: Special characters in strings (like `\n` for new line).
- **Comments**: How to write notes in your code so others (and you) can understand it later.
- **Constants**: Naming values that should not change (by convention, use ALL_CAPS).
- **Operators**:
	- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
	- Relational: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
	- Equality: `==`, `!=`
	- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`
