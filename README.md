## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with the basics**: Make sure you understand the foundational concepts before moving to advanced topics.
2. **Practice coding problems**: Focus on sections with coding exercises, especially decision making, loops, strings, and data structures.
3. **Prepare for interviews**: Most interview questions are based on the following topics:
	- Programming Basics
	- Decision Making and Loops
	- Strings
	- Data Structures
	- File Handling
	- Exception Handling
	- Decorators
	- Generators

> **Tip:** Exception Handling, Decorators, and Generators are especially important. Expect multiple interview questions from these sections.
